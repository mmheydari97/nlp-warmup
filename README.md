# NLP

This repository contains python natural language tool kit (nltk) basics.

### Prerequisites

[This](https://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/NLP-Python-Machine-Learning-Essential-Training/622075-2.html) tutorial can help you understand basics of natural language processing (NLP).

### Table of contents
| | Chapter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | 
|1| **[NLP Basics](Chapter1)** | NLTK overview. Using regex for text data. Using Machine Learning pipelines for preprocessing.
|2| **[Supplemental Data Cleaning](Chapter2)** | Introducing and comparing stemming and lemmatization.
|3| **[Vectorizing Raw Data](Chapter3)** | Introducing and comparing vectorization methods like count vectorization, N-gram and inverse document frequency weighting.
|4| **[Feature Engineering](Chapter4)** | Feature creation. Feature evaluation. Identifying candidate features for transformation. Box-Cox power transformation. 
|5| **[Building Machine Learning Classifiers](Chapter5)** | Cross validation. Evaluation metrics. Hold out method. Random Forest classifier. Grid search for hyperparameter adjustment. Gradient Boosting method.

### Note
You will probably need to install nltk on a virtual environment and then use that virtual environment
in a Jupyter Notebook. If so, you can find commands needed in [instructions.txt](instructions.txt).
